# Online Multimedia (Multimedia im Netz, MMN) Example-Code and Exercises #

Here, you can find the material for all exercises we did during the tutorials 
and code skeletons for assignments and break-out tasks. 
  
## Major Subject (Hauptfach, NF) ## 
This folder will contain all examples for the major subject. Currently, we maintain
 a different repository to avoid confusion: https://github.com/MIMUC-MMN/tutorials-16-17
 
 When the semester is over, we'll add everything in here, too.
