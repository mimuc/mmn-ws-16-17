# Required Toolkit #

Over the course of the semester you will need to install a couple of tools. We're trying to keep it as simple as possible. To do the Break-Out exercises during the tutorials and to complete all assignments, make sure to install these tools beforehand. I've ordered them according to their importance.

- Git. https://git-scm.com/ install it, then go straight ahead to this tutorial, if you don't know git: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
- NodeJS + npm. https://nodejs.org/en/ ? If you have npm running, install these (you can do that from the Git-Bash):
  - Bower `npm install -g bower`
  - Express Generator `npm install -g express`
  - Polymer-CLI `npm install -g polymer-cli`
  - gulp `npm install -g gulp`
  - Browser-Sync `npm install -g browser-sync`
- Text Editor / Web IDE * - choose one - * 
  - Atom https://atom.io/
  - Sublime https://www.sublimetext.com/
  - WebStorm (free for students here: https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students)
  - VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download 
- XAMP stack. I recommend xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html . But you can install the components separately, if you like.
- MongoDB https://www.mongodb.com/ I'm not sure we will need it this year, but you can try it.
- VirtualBox - if you don't want to install all this on your machine, we provide a bundled image. 

I know it seems a lot, but please take the time to install everything, then we can focus on the content during the semester. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or to suggest alternatives!
